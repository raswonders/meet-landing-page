- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

As usually i've started with design mobile design first, this time however i hard coded the data inside components. After having html and visual styling I've proceeded styling for tablet and then destkop. I had to go back few times on my tablet changes when I was dealing with destkop size. Doing both of those sizes at once would probably save me some time.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library

### What I learned

I tinkered with bg images responsiveness and I think I got better at it. I also get to use flexbox a lot, grid not so much. Most satisfying was when I fixed positioning bug in a footer. I found out that relative positioning can be a really good friend.

### Continued development

I liked the challenge it took me for quite a ride. I think I'll be using some of the tricks I learned like relative positioning for overlays and such.
